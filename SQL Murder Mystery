# This was a fun game to use SQL to solve a murder mystery on this website: https://mystery.knightlab.com/

# First I found out all tables in the database
SELECT name 
  FROM sqlite_master
 where type = 'table' 
/* Shows all tables under this database*/

# Then I found out the structure within each table
SELECT sql 
  FROM sqlite_master
 where name = 'crime_scene_report'
/* Shows the structure for this table*/

Answer: I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. 
The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".

SELECT * FROM get_fit_now_check_in
Where check_in_date is '20180109'
AND membership_id LIKE '%48z%';
Answers:
48Z7A
48Z55

SELECT * FROM get_fit_now_member
Where id is '48Z55' OR id is '48Z7A';
Answers:
48Z7A - 28819 - Joe Germuska - 20160305 - gold
48Z55 - 67318 - Jeremy Bowers - 20160101 - gold

SELECT * FROM person
Where id is '67318' OR id is '28819';
Answers:
id	name	license_id	address_number	address_street_name	ssn
67318	Jeremy Bowers	423327	530	Washington Pl, Apt 3A		871539279
28819	Joe Germuska	173289	111	Fisk Rd				138909730

SELECT * FROM drivers_license
Where id is '423327' OR id is '173289';

423327	30	70	brown	brown	male	0H42W2	Chevrolet	Spark LS

##First guess on the murder
INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Jeremy Bowers');
SELECT value FROM solution;

Answer: Congrats, you found the murderer! 
But wait, there's more... If you think you're up for a challenge, 
try querying the interview transcript of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime. 
If you feel especially confident in your SQL skills, try to complete this final step with no more than 2 queries. 
Use this same INSERT statement with your new suspect to check your answer.

## Now I have to find the "real villain"
SELECT * FROM interview
Where person_id is '67318';

Answer:
I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). 
She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.


Select * FROM drivers_license WHERE car_model = 'Model S' AND gender = 'female';
id	age	height	eye_color	hair_color	gender	plate_number	car_make	car_model
202298	68	66	green	red	female	500123	Tesla	Model S
291182	65	66	blue	red	female	08CM64	Tesla	Model S
682231	51	80	green	grey	female	3Z0M62	Tesla	Model S
918773	48	65	black	red	female	917UU3	Tesla	Model S

Select * FROM person WHERE license_id = 202298
Answer:
id	name	license_id	address_number	address_street_name	ssn
99716	Miranda Priestly	202298	1883	Golden Ave	987756388

SELECT * FROM income WHERE SSN = 961388910 278K
SELECT * FROM income WHERE SSN = 337169072 ?
SELECT * FROM income WHERE SSN = 987756388 310K (highest)

##Found her :)
INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Miranda Priestly');
SELECT value FROM solution;

Answer: 
Congrats, you found the brains behind the murder! Everyone in SQL City hails you as the greatest SQL detective of all time. 
Time to break out the champagne!
